**👋 I'm Adam Green, an energy engineer turned data professional**.

My career is focused on climate change - most commonly I'm using data to enable more renewable energy.

I've worked:

- As a data analyst, scientist and engineer, across all three of the core data roles
- For large energy companies and small clean-tech startups
- On both AWS and Azure
- With the Serverless, AWS CDK, and Databricks Asset Bundle Infrastructure-as-Code tools

I wear three hats:

1. Energy professional
2. Data professional
3. Mentor (I enjoy helping others)

Currently I'm working as a Lead Data Scientist at Meridian Energy.
