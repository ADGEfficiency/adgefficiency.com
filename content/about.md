👋 I'm Adam Green, an energy engineer turned data professional. My work is focused on using data to prevent climate change by enabling renewable energy with models and data.

I've worked across all three of the core data roles - data analyst, scientist and engineer.  I've worked for large energy companies and small clean-tech startups, on AWS and Azure.

I wear three hats - energy professional, data professional (with a focus on data science), and mentor (I enjoy helping others).

Currently I'm working as a Lead Data Scientist at Meridian Energy.
