Energy engineer turned data professional. My work is focused on using data to prevent climate change.

I am interested in the different outcomes we get when we design and optimize energy systems for money or for the environment - the space that exists between economic and carbon optimization.

I've worked across all three of the core data roles - data analyst, scientist and engineer.

I wear three hats - energy professional, data professional (with a focus on data science), mentor (I enjoy helping others).

Currently I'm working as a Lead Data Scientist at Meridian Energy.
