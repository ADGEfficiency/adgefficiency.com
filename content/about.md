👋 I'm Adam Green, an energy engineer turned data professional. My career is focused on climate change - most commonly I'm using data to enable more renewable energy.

I've worked:

- Across all three of the core data roles - data analyst, scientist and engineer
- For large energy companies and small clean-tech startups
- On AWS and Azure

I wear three hats:

1. Energy professional
2. Data professional
3. Mentor (I enjoy helping others)

Currently I'm working as a Lead Data Scientist at Meridian Energy.
